# My name is Hossein Jafarinia

I am a researcher with a deep interest in **Machine Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Medical Image Analysis**, and **Computer Vision**. My work has primarily revolved around developing novel architectures and methods for **Whole Slide Image (WSI) Classification** and **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)**, with applications in cancer detection and localization. Over the course of my academic journey, I have collaborated closely with research teams, mentored interns, and contributed to significant publications in my field.

## Education

### Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, Iran
**M.S. in Computer Engineering** (2021 – 2024)  
- **Thesis**: Classification and Localization of Cancer in Histology Images Using Weak Label  
  Developed a new framework featuring a novel sparse transformer-based MIL-pooling method, which achieved state-of-the-art results in WSI classification.

### Bu-Ali Sina University (BASU), Hamedan, Iran
**B.S. in Computer Engineering** (2015 – 2020)  
- **Final Project**: Detection of Infected Blood Cells by Malaria  
  Designed and implemented a model for detecting malaria-infected blood cells, contributing to automated diagnostics.

## Research Experience

### RIML Lab at SUT  
**Tehran, Iran**  
**Supervision**: *Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban*  
**Sep. 2021 - Present**  
Dedicated my entire Master’s program to this lab, focusing on developing architectures, theories, and frameworks for gigapixel images. I led literature reviews, intern mentorship, and team management, contributing to both theoretical and practical advancements. Published two papers (AAAI 2023 workshop and ECCV 2024) with state-of-the-art results in WSI classification. Currently, I am researching WSI classification techniques with an emphasis on data augmentation, as well as exploring loss landscape analysis in neural networks.

### ML Lab at SUT  
**Tehran, Iran**  
**Supervision**: *Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*  
**Jun. 2024 - Present**  
Currently studying the effects of the loss landscape on the generalization and robustness of deep neural networks. This research aims to develop improved mapping techniques to understand this complex concept better.

### RIV Lab at BASU  
**Tehran, Iran**  
**Supervision**: *Dr. Hassan Khotanlou*  
**Jul. 2019 - Sep. 2020**  
During my undergraduate studies, I worked on advancing medical vision applications. I mastered both classic computer vision techniques and modern concepts, which led to developing a successful malaria blood cell detection model. I modified the state-of-the-art RetinaNet model to achieve exceptional performance in this challenging task.

## Projects

- **Implementation of SAC Algorithm for Offline Reinforcement Learning**  
  Implemented the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to improve offline reinforcement learning performance, with extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets.

- **Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for Histology WSIs**  
  Adapted OpenAI's CLIP model for histology whole slide image classification, enabling the model to leverage text-image pairings for improved image understanding.

- **Cancer Mutation Detection with Microarray Data**  
  Developed a machine learning pipeline for detecting cancer mutations based on microarray gene expression data.

- **Small Molecule Quantum Feature Extraction and Target Protein Docking**  
  Focused on quantum feature extraction in small molecules and performed docking simulations to predict interactions between target proteins and small molecules.
