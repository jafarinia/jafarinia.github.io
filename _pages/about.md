# My name is Hossein Jafarinia

I am a researcher with a deep interest in **Computer Vision**, **Medical Image Analysis**, and **Digital Pathology**. My work has primarily revolved around developing novel architectures and methods for **Whole Slide Image (WSI) Classification** and **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)**, with applications in cancer detection and localization. Over the course of my academic journey, I have collaborated closely with research teams, mentored interns, and contributed to significant publications in my field.

## Education

### Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, Iran
**M.S. in Computer Engineering** (2021 – 2024)  
- **Thesis**: Classification and Localization of Cancer in Histology Images Using Weak Label  
  Developed a new framework featuring a novel sparse transformer-based MIL-pooling method, which achieved state-of-the-art results in WSI classification.

### Bu-Ali Sina University (BASU), Hamedan, Iran
**B.S. in Computer Engineering** (2015 – 2020)  
- **Final Project**: Detection of Infected Blood Cells by Malaria  
  Designed and implemented a model for detecting malaria-infected blood cells, contributing to automated diagnostics.

  Developed linguistic materials for Isfahani, a low-resource Persian dialect, and managed resources for other underrepresented Persian languages as part of an effort to document and publish them.

<!-- ## Research Experience -->

<!-- ### RIML Lab at SUT  
**Tehran, Iran**  
**Supervision**: *Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban*  
**Sep. 2021 - Present**  
Dedicated my entire Master’s program to this lab, focusing on developing architectures, theories, and frameworks for gigapixel images. I led literature reviews, intern mentorship, and team management, contributing to both theoretical and practical advancements. Published two papers (AAAI 2023 workshop and ECCV 2024) with state-of-the-art results in WSI classification. Currently, I am researching WSI classification techniques with an emphasis on data augmentation, as well as exploring Neural Collapse in neural networks. -->

<!-- ### ML Lab at SUT  
**Tehran, Iran**  
**Supervision**: *Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*  
**Jun. 2024 - Present**  
Currently studying the effects of the Neural Collapse on the generalization and robustness of deep neural networks. This research aims to develop improved techniques to understand this complex concept better.  -->

<!-- ### RIV Lab at BASU  
**Tehran, Iran**  
**Supervision**: *Dr. Hassan Khotanlou*  
**Jul. 2019 - Sep. 2020**  
During my undergraduate studies, I worked on advancing medical vision applications. I mastered both classic computer vision techniques and modern concepts, which led to developing a successful malaria blood cell detection model. I modified the state-of-the-art RetinaNet model to achieve exceptional performance in this challenging task. -->

## Projects

<!-- - **Implementation of SAC Algorithm for Offline Reinforcement Learning**  
  Implemented the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to improve offline reinforcement learning performance, with extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets. -->
